## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with scripting and automation in Roblox. You’ll learn how to set up your tools, understand the basics of Lua, interact with Roblox games, and automate common tasks.

---

## What You Need

- **Roblox Account**: Sign up at [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com/).
- **Roblox Client**: Download and install from the official website.
- **Script Executor**: A program that lets you run Lua scripts in Roblox games. Popular options:
    - [KRNL (Free)](https://krnl.place/)
    - [Synapse X (Paid)](https://x.synapse.to/)
    - [Script-Ware (Paid)](https://script-ware.com/)
- **Text Editor**: For writing scripts. Recommended:
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- **Remote Spy Tool**: To inspect game events and remotes.
    - [SimpleSpy](https://github.com/exxtremestuffs/SimpleSpySource) (free, open source)

---

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Install Roblox and create an account.**
2. **Download and install your chosen script executor.**
3. **Install a text editor for writing and saving scripts.**
4. **(Optional) Download SimpleSpy for inspecting remotes.**

---

## Lua Scripting Basics

Roblox uses Lua, a simple and powerful scripting language. Here are some basics:

```lua
-- Variables
local myName = "Player"

-- Functions
local function greet(name)
    print("Hello, " .. name)
end

greet(myName)

-- If statements
if myName == "Player" then
    print("Welcome!")
else
    print("Unknown user.")
end
```

---

## Understanding Roblox Game Structure

- **Services**: Core systems like `Players`, `Workspace`, `ReplicatedStorage`.
- **Objects**: Everything in Roblox is an object (parts, models, scripts).
- **Events**: Used for communication (e.g., when a player clicks a button).

**Example:**
```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
```

---

## Using a Script Executor

1. **Open your script executor.**
2. **Join a Roblox game.**
3. **Attach the executor to the game (usually a button labeled “Attach”).**
4. **Paste your Lua script into the executor.**
5. **Click “Execute” to run your script.**

---

## Finding Remotes & Game Events

To automate actions, you often need to interact with remote events/functions.  
**SimpleSpy** helps you find these:

1. Paste the SimpleSpy script into your executor and run it.
2. Perform the action you want to automate in-game (e.g., collect a coin).
3. SimpleSpy will log the remote event/function call.
4. Copy the code SimpleSpy provides for that action.

---

## Practical Automation Examples

### Auto Collect Coins

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local CollectPickup = ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.Pickups.CollectPickup

for _, coin in ipairs(workspace:GetDescendants()) do
    if coin:IsA("BasePart") and (coin.Name == "Coin" or string.match(coin.Name, "Meshes/bgscoin%d+")) then
        CollectPickup:FireServer(coin:GetAttribute("ID"))
    end
end

workspace.DescendantAdded:Connect(function(obj)
    if obj:IsA("BasePart") and (obj.Name == "Coin" or string.match(obj.Name, "Meshes/bgscoin%d+")) then
        CollectPickup:FireServer(obj:GetAttribute("ID"))
    end
end)
```

### Expand Player Hitbox

```lua
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
local root = character:FindFirstChild("HumanoidRootPart")
if root then
    root.Size = Vector3.new(10, 10, 10) -- Change numbers for size
    root.Transparency = 1 -- Invisible hitbox
end
```

### Auto Clicker

```lua
_G.autoClick = true
while _G.autoClick do
    -- Replace with the correct remote for your game
    game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Aero.AeroRemoteServices.ClickService.Click:FireServer(1)
    wait(0.1)
end
```

### Auto Farm (General Example)

```lua
_G.autoFarm = true
while _G.autoFarm do
    -- Replace with your game's farming remote
    game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Remotes.Farm:FireServer()
    wait(1)
end
```

## Best Practices & Safety

- **Test in a private or alt account.**
- **Never share your account or executor.**
- **Only download executors and tools from trusted sources.**
- **Do not use scripts to harm or disrupt games.**
- **Respect Roblox’s Terms of Service and game-specific rules.**

## Example Executor Script

Here’s a template you can use in your executor:

```lua
-- Example: Auto Collect Coins Script
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local CollectPickup = ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.Pickups.CollectPickup

for _, coin in ipairs(workspace:GetDescendants()) do
    if coin:IsA("BasePart") and (coin.Name == "Coin" or string.match(coin.Name, "Meshes/bgscoin%d+")) then
        CollectPickup:FireServer(coin:GetAttribute("ID"))
    end
end

workspace.DescendantAdded:Connect(function(obj)
    if obj:IsA("BasePart") and (obj.Name == "Coin" or string.match(obj.Name, "Meshes/bgscoin%d+")) then
        CollectPickup:FireServer(obj:GetAttribute("ID"))
    end
end)
```

## FAQ

**Q: Is scripting/automation allowed on Roblox?**  
A: Scripting is allowed in Roblox Studio for game development. Using automation in live games can violate Roblox’s Terms of Service. Always use scripts responsibly and for learning purposes.

**Q: What if my executor doesn’t work?**  
A: Make sure you’re using the latest version and that it’s compatible with your system. Some executors may be blocked by antivirus software.

**Q: Where can I find more scripts?**  
A: Check out scripting communities, GitHub, and Roblox developer forums.
