# 9. Troubleshooting

## Common Problems and How to Fix Them

### My script won’t run!
- Make sure your executor is attached to the game.
- Double-check that you pasted the script correctly.
- Try restarting Roblox and your executor.

### I get a “nil value” error.
- This means something in your script doesn’t exist yet.
- Check your spelling and make sure the object or variable is created before you use it.

### The game updated and my script broke!
- Games change often. You may need to find new remotes or update your script.
- Use SimpleSpy again to find the new remote events.

### My antivirus blocks the executor.
- Some executors are flagged as viruses. Only use trusted sources.
- You may need to allow the executor in your antivirus settings (be careful!).

### Still stuck?
- Google the error message.
- Ask for help on Roblox scripting forums or Discord servers.
- Try reading the earlier steps again to make sure you didn’t miss anything.
