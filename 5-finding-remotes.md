# 5. Finding Remotes

Remotes are how games talk between your computer and the server.

## Using SimpleSpy

1. Copy the SimpleSpy script.
2. Paste it into your executor and run it.
3. Do something in the game (like collect a coin).
4. SimpleSpy will show you the remote event.
5. Copy the code SimpleSpy gives you.

Now you can use this code in your own scripts!
